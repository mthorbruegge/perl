EPSO.PL 
=======

Description: 
Retrieve and store content from the EPSO website. Only Temporary Agent posts with grade
group AD are considered right now. The single records from the EPSO website are stored
in a textfile in the subfolder 

<SOMEPATH>/epso/text

New records (== new entries never seen before) are marked with

***** NEW *****

at the beginning. The decision, if a text record is new is by generating a SHA hash over 
the record and compare it to all previously seen hash records. The hashes are stored in 
a file called

<SOMEPATH>/epso/text/hashes.txt
